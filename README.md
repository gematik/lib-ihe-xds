## About The Project

IHE profiles for exchange of medical documents are used in more and more projects worldwide. They represent a modern, international basis for the electronic
exchange of medical data in the healthcare sector.
As the profiles are quite complex and the objects are difficult to understand, we provide a library that converts human-readable Document-Request and Responses
to IHE conform Objects. Hereby, the mapping contains no validation, it maps exactly what is given.

It supports the following IHE operations:

- Provide and Register Document Set-b [ITI-41]
- Registry Stored Query [ITI-18] with the following query names:
    - FindDocuments
    - FindDocumentsByTitle
    - FindDocumentsByComment
    - FindDocumentsByReferenceId
    - FindFolders
    - GetAll
    - GetFolderAndContents
- Retrieve Document Set [ITI-43]
- Remove Metadata [ITI-62]
- Restricted Update Document Set (ITI-92)

### Release Notes

The Release-Notes can be found in the file [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In case you want to clone the project you need:

* Git
* Java JDK 17 or newer (Tested on OpenJDK)
* Maven 3.8.0 or newer

In case you just want to use the built artefact in your project get it as dependency.

Maven:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.gematik.epa</groupId>
      <artifactId>lib-ihe-xds</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>  

For gradle it is

    implementation 'de.gematik.epa:lib-ihe-xds:x.y.z'

## Usage

This project is a library and only contains utility methods for the conversion to IHE-Request and from IHE-Responses.
Currently we support saving, finding, retrieving, replacing and removing of documents.

The class [de.gematik.epa.LibIheXdsMain](src/main/java/de/gematik/epa/LibIheXdsMain.java) is the main class,
which contains static methods for the supported conversions.

To delve in deeper, in

- [AdhocQueryUtils.java](src/main/java/de/gematik/epa/conversion/AdhocQueryUtils.java)
- [DeleteObjectsUtils.java](src/main/java/de/gematik/epa/conversion/DeleteObjectUtils.java)
- [ProvideAndRegisterUtils.java](src/main/java/de/gematik/epa/conversion/ProvideAndRegisterUtils.java)
- [RetrieveDocumentUtils.java](src/main/java/de/gematik/epa/conversion/RetrieveDocumentUtils.java)

you can find the methods for converting a given DocumentObject to corresponding IHE/XDS objects.

In [ResponseUtils.java](src/main/java/de/gematik/epa/conversion/ResponseUtils.java) you can find the conversion from IHE-Responses to DocumentObjects.
